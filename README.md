Hi, I'm Owen. I have experience in mechanics and data analysis, however, my true passion has always been in programming and development, and I have strong attention to detail and inclination for problem-solving. I have recently graduated from a coding Traineeship as a full stack developer including completing 2 real-world projects successfully to specification using a wide range of programming languages.

I am currently looking for my first role as a Software Developer as well as continuing to learn and improve my skills. At the moment, I am focused on learning more C# and .NET
